  <p> – Toddlers (age 20-24 months) seem to clearly recognize that the reflection in the mirror is their own. The clear sign of this is that while looking in the mirror, they touch the dot of lipstick on their own nose instead of touching the mirror.

Of course, the results of this mirror test for babies are not clear-cut. Just because a toddler recognizes themselves in the mirror doesn’t necessarily mean they have a complete mental concept of themselves. Visual recognition may not completely correlate to mental self-perception. Other, more complex studies would have to be conducted to determine when the mental concept of the self emerges.

Interestingly, animal studies have shown that some of the more intelligent mammals such as elephants, dolphins, and chimpanzees also recognize themselves in the mirror. Does this mean that these animals have a mental concept of “the self?” Who knows? It seems unlikely but maybe so. All these animals have fairly complex social systems so maybe they do have a concept of self.

7.  Notice the effects of kindness

One of the best parts of being kind is that it feels good. Talk with your child about how performing even small acts of kindness can bring him joy. Stories like “Have You Filled a Bucket Today?” by Carol McCloud explain this concept well. Each time we do something nice, we bring happiness to others (and ourselves too). While we don’t behave kindly only for the reward, it’s certainly a nice bonus.

Point out how your child feels when he is treated with kindness to help him develop gratitude. Once he recognizes how good it feels to both give and receive kindness, it will be easy to maintain this behavior.

Wrap-Up

The benefits of kindness for kids are clear. Children who are kind to others feel happier, more connected and less stressed. Nurturing kindness in children is key, and daily life provides plenty of opportunities for practice. Most importantly, be sure to model kindness in your interactions with others, as your child will naturally watch and learn.
